This folder contains:
 - fluid_params.dat files for stability of conducting surface in an electric field.
 - the folder 'F0.8_profiles' which gives the all grid values at specific times during the simulation of an unstable interface.
 - gnuplot scripts to plot various parameters.

The value of 'F' in the file names is the stability parameter: F^2 = 4*pi*epsilon_0*E^2 / gamma, where E is the electric field strength, gamma is the surface tension and epsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space, 8.85x10^-12 m^-3 kg^-1 s^4 A^2.

Each fluid_params file contains a timeseries of various parameters of the fluid. Column (3) gives the volume of the fluid, column (2) gives the difference between the height of the liquid surface at the centre and outer edge of the simulation (ie. the amplitude of the instability) and column (4) gives the height of the liquid at the outer edge of the simulation.

The bash script 'ERTrates.bash' extracts growth rates from column (3) of the fluid_params.dat files by using gnuplot to least-squares fit exponential curves to the data. The results are saved in 'ERTrates.dat' which may be plotted, along with the results of Melcher's inviscid linear perturbation theory, using the gnuplot script 'ERTrates.plt'.

The folder 'F0.8_profiles' includes a gnuplot script to plot the evolution of the liquid surface profile.
