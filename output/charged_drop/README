This folder contains:
 - fluid_params.dat files for stability of charged conducting drop.
 - the folder 'Q1.04_profiles' which gives the all grid values at specific times during the simulation of an unstable droplet.
 - gnuplot scripts to plot various parameters.

The value of 'Q' in the file names is the stability parameter: Q^2 = q^2 / (16*pi^2*epsilon_0*r^3*gamma), where q is the total charge on the droplet, gamma is the surface tension, r is the droplet radius and epsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space, 8.85x10^-12 m^-3 kg^-1 s^4 A^2.

Each fluid_params file contains a timeseries of various parameters of the fluid. Column (2) gives the volume of the fluid and column (5) gives the aspect ratio of the droplet. Columns (3) and (4) measure the amplitude of the surface perturbation from a spherical shape but these have not been analyzed.

The gnuplot scripts 'AforQ.plt' and 'VforQ.plt' plot the evolution over time of the droplet aspect ratio and fractional change in volume.

The folder 'Q1.04_profiles' includes a gnuplot script to plot the evolution of the liquid surface profile.
